"""LangChain integration for StackSpot AI.

This module provides LangChain integration for StackSpot AI, enabling
orchestration of multiple StackSpot agents using LangChain chains and tools.

Main Components:
    - StackSpotChatModel: LangChain-compatible wrapper for StackSpot agents
    - create_coder_differ_chain: Chain that orchestrates Coder â†’ Differ agents
    - create_simple_coder_chain: Simplified chain with just the Coder agent
    - read_file: Tool for reading source code files

Example:
    ```python
    from buddyctl.langchain_integration import (
        StackSpotChatModel,
        create_coder_differ_chain
    )
    
    # Create orchestration chain
    chain = create_coder_differ_chain(
        coder_agent_id="your-coder-agent-id",
        differ_agent_id="your-differ-agent-id"
    )
    
    # Execute chain
    result = chain.invoke({
        "file_path": "src/main.py",
        "instruction": "Add email validation"
    })
    
    print(result["diff"])
    ```
