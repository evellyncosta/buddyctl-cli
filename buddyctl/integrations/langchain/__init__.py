"""LangChain integration for StackSpot AI.

This module provides LangChain integration for StackSpot AI, enabling
orchestration of StackSpot agents using LangChain chains, tools, and agents.

Main Components:
    - StackSpotChatModel: LangChain-compatible wrapper for StackSpot agents
    - create_buddyctl_agent: ReAct Agent with automatic tool execution
    - read_file: Tool for reading source code files

Example (ReAct Agent - Recommended):
    ```python
    from buddyctl.integrations.langchain import (
        create_buddyctl_agent
    )
    from buddyctl.core.providers import ProviderManager

    # Get LangChain model
    manager = ProviderManager(config)
    llm = manager.get_langchain_model()

    # Create agent with tools
    agent = create_buddyctl_agent(llm, verbose=True)

    # Execute - agent will automatically use tools
    result = agent.invoke({"input": "altere calculator.py para 3 n√∫meros"})
    print(result["output"])
    ```
