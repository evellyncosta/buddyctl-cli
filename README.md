# BuddyCtl

CLI tool for managing StackSpot AI assistants (buddies).

## Installation

Install BuddyCtl using pip:

```bash
pip install buddyctl
```

**Verify Installation:**

```bash
buddyctl --help
```

**Upgrading:**

```bash
pip install --upgrade buddyctl
```

## Configuration

### Setting up StackSpot Provider

BuddyCtl currently supports **StackSpot AI** as the LLM provider. You'll need to configure one agent in your StackSpot account:

#### 1. Get StackSpot Credentials

Generate your API credentials in your [StackSpot account](https://stackspot.com):
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Realm

#### 2. Create Main Agent in StackSpot

You need to create **one agent** in StackSpot AI:

**Main Agent (Coder Agent)**
- **Purpose**: Generates responses and code modifications using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks
- **Recommended Prompt**: Use the validated prompt from [`prompts/main_agent.md`](prompts/main_agent.md)
- **Custom Prompts**: You can use your own prompt if preferred
- **Characteristics**: Natural, conversational tone; generates SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for code modifications

> **Note**: The validated prompt in `prompts/main_agent.md` is tested and optimized for the SEARCH/REPLACE pattern. While you can use custom prompts, the provided one is recommended for best results.

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```env
# Required: StackSpot Authentication
STACKSPOT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
STACKSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
STACKSPOT_REALM=your_realm_here

# Required: StackSpot API URLs
STACKSPOT_AUTH_URL=https://idm.stackspot.com
STACKSPOT_API_URL=https://genai-inference-app.stackspot.com

# Required: Main Agent ID (from StackSpot AI dashboard)
STACKSPOT_CODER_ID=your_main_agent_id_here

# Deprecated (no longer used)
# STACKSPOT_JUDGE_AGENT_ID=your_judge_agent_id_here
```

**Authentication and Main Agent ID are required.** BuddyCtl uses a single-stage SEARCH/REPLACE pattern with local validation for fast and reliable code modifications.

#### Architecture Details

For more information about how the SEARCH/REPLACE pattern works, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#searchreplace-pattern-single-stage-tool-calling).

**Future Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers is planned but not yet implemented. Currently, only StackSpot AI is supported.

## Usage

After installation and configuration, use BuddyCtl directly:

```bash
# Run the interactive shell
buddyctl

# Login with your credentials (if not authenticated)
buddyctl auth login

# Show help
buddyctl --help
```

## Features

- üîê OAuth2 authentication with StackSpot
- ü§ñ Agent management and configuration
- üí¨ Interactive chat with streaming responses
- üõ†Ô∏è **Single-stage SEARCH/REPLACE pattern** with local validation
- üîÑ Automatic validation and retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
- üìù Code modification with SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (50% faster than previous approach)
- üìÅ File autocompletion with @ navigation
- üîç Real-time file indexing and suggestions
- üìã Command history and auto-suggestions
- üîå Provider abstraction layer (OpenAI, Anthropic planned)

## Usage Examples

### Authentication
```bash
# Login with your credentials
buddyctl auth login
```

### Interactive Shell
```bash
# Start the interactive shell
buddyctl

# Inside the shell:
/help              # Show available commands
/status            # Check auth and agent status
/clear             # Clear screen
/exit              # Exit shell

# Chat with the agent (any message without /)
Hello, how can you help me?

# Reference files in your messages using @
Can you review @src/main.py and suggest improvements?

# Request code modifications (automatically applied)
Add type hints to @calculator.py
```

## Using as a Library

BuddyCtl can be used as a library in other Python projects:

```python
# Install from PyPI
pip install buddyctl

# Or install from git
pip install git+https://github.com/evellyncosta/buddyctl-cli.git

# Use the LangChain integration
import os
from buddyctl.integrations.langchain import StackSpotChatModel
from buddyctl.integrations.langchain.chains import StackSpotChain
from buddyctl.integrations.langchain.tools import read_file

# Create a StackSpot chat model using environment variable
model = StackSpotChatModel(
    agent_id=os.getenv("STACKSPOT_CODER_ID")
)
response = model.invoke("Explain Python decorators")

# Use SEARCH/REPLACE pattern for code modifications
chain = StackSpotChain(
    main_agent_id=os.getenv("STACKSPOT_CODER_ID"),
    tools=[read_file]  # Tools available to the chain
)

result = chain.invoke("Add type hints to calculator.py")

print(result["output"])           # Final response
print(result["tool_calls_made"])  # Tools that were executed
print(result["blocks_applied"])   # Number of SEARCH/REPLACE blocks applied
print(result["validation_rounds"]) # Number of validation rounds (0 = success first try)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found: buddyctl
If you installed with pip, make sure the installation directory is in your PATH.

### Authentication fails
- Verify your credentials in `.env` file
- Check if all required variables are set correctly
- Try: `buddyctl auth login`
